The envisioned control that will be exercised on the sailboat will consist of but not be limited to the following:
  1. Directional heading control
  2. Optimal speed control
  3. Tacking, jabbing and normal sailing control
  4. GPS Navigation 
  
The project requires the following skills to fully develop the control system and hardware platform
  1. Control Systems
  2. Simulink/Matlab development
  3. C++ Application development
  4. Hardware development
  
    A. PIXHAWK flght controller
    
    B. Multiple sensor integration(Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass, GPS, Wind Sensor and SD Card)
    
    C. Wirelles Radio communication between sailboat and base station
