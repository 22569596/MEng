The envisioned control that will be exercised on the sailboat will consist of but not be limited to the following:
  1. Directional heading control
  2. Optimal speed control
  3. Tacking, jabbing and normal sailing control
  4. GPS Navigation 
  
The project requires the following skills to fully develop the control system and hardware platform
  1. Control Systems
  2. Simulink/Matlab Modeling
  3. C# Application development
  4. C++ Firmware to Control sailboat
  5. Hardware development
  
    A. PIXHAWK flght controller
    
    B. Multiple sensor integration(Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass, GPS, Wind Sensor and SD Card)
    
    C. Wirelles Radio communication between sailboat and base station
    
# Simulations

I have implemented a full navigation system on a non-linear sailboat model in Matlab. Die sim is used as a platform to test different control strategies and the overall navigation capabilities of the sailboat. The simulation also comes with a visualizer. Below is a example of the xy-plot of the sailboat navigation between waypoints.
